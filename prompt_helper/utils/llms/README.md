# Custom Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the `llms` directory! This folder contains custom classes for Large Language Models (LLMs) that are designed to work with the `langchain` framework.

## Overview

The `llms` directory is a collection of custom models that serve as an integral part of our prompt optimization process. By leveraging the `langchain` framework, we aim to provide a seamless integration and enhancement of language models that can be tailored to specific tasks and workflows.

## Structure

Each file within this directory represents a unique class of a Large Language Model, structured to be compatible with the `langchain` framework. These classes are intended to be used as plug-and-play modules within our broader language processing pipeline.
